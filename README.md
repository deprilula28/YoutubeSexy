# YoutubeSexy
This is a website that's supposed to be a Google Materialize'd version of YouTube that uses the API for requests and authentication.

## Try it out
There is a bunch of functionality missing still, but you can try it out here:<br>

The website version doesn't have the latest features, you can get those by using github's download to ZIP function.<br>
You can then unzip it and open the web/index.html file with Chrome (From my tests, it doesn't work properly locally with Firefox or Edge).
